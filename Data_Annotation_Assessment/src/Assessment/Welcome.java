	 * 
	 * In this exercise, you will develop a function named decode(message_file). 
	 * This function should read an encoded message from a .txt file and return its 
	 * decoded version as a string.
	 * 
	 * Your function must be able to process an input file with the following format:
	 * 3 love
	 * 6 computers
	 * 2 dogs
	 * 4 cats
	 * 1 I
	 * 5 you
	 * 
	 * In this file, each line contains a number followed by a word. The task is to decode a 
	 * hidden message based on the arrangement of these numbers into a "pyramid" structure. 
	 * The numbers are placed into the pyramid in ascending order, with each line of the pyramid 
	 * having one more number than the line above it. The smallest number is 1, and the numbers 
	 * increase consecutively, like so:
	 *   1
	 *  2 3
	 * 4 5 6
	 * 
	 * The key to decoding the message is to use the words corresponding to the numbers at the 
	 * end of each pyramid line (in this example, 1, 3, and 6). You should ignore all the other 
	 * words. So for the example input file above, the message words are:
	 * 1: I
	 * 3: love
	 * 6: computers
	 * and your function should return the string "I love computers".
